# Launch Project Box
This is a repo for files associated with the Launch Project Box.

## Join the fun!
These project boxes contain our favorite supplies for fun (and educational) projects within the box's theme.  In addition to a standard kit of parts and material, the boxes ship with a current collection of the best open-source designs that add extra fun to the boxes.  These designs are developed during each quarterly project cycle.  There are three ways for students to get involved in a project cycle.

### 1: Young Engineer Series (Age: 7-14)
We show lots of fun activities that can be done with these project boxes for students in the 7-14 age range.  More importantly, we encourage students to think about how they can apply their academic knowledge in creative ways to come up with their own creations and join us for some fun challenges!  There's an extra bonus prize for new challenge leaders and for anyone who can "Beat Chris" in a challenge!

### 2: Innovation Team (Age: 14 and up)
Ever wondered how students can get involved in real product design? This is it!

We explain how we design custom parts (mechanical and electronic) for manufacturing and walk students through how they can do it themselves!  Students can share their designs with the community and we'll select the best designs to be included in the current revision of the project box when it ships out!  We'll also send some project boxes to Amazon so students can even show their friends how the product they helped design is available through Amazon prime!

### 3: Launch Team (Age: 14 and up)
Some students would rather make a YouTube video or learn to start a business instead of designing a new product.  For students in our Launch Team program, that's exactly what they can do!

We share a lot of our insight and experience in business, online marketing, and video creation while we challenge students to get involved in real marketing efforts for Idea7 products!  Obviously this can help Idea7 spread the word and build our community, but more importantly, this is a great opportunity for students to get real experience!

## Raise the Future (Parents and Teachers)
We know most parents and teachers understand the importance of project-based learning (or experiencial learning) for building an understanding of important STEM/STEAM concepts and for developing necessary life skills.  We also know most us don't do as much project-based learning as we should because it can take a lot more effort and time.  

Our "Raise the Future" series is specifically intended to help well-meaning parents and teachers by making things a bit easier and providing some much-deserverd support and resources.  This is our little way of telling you how much we appreciate the impact you're making and the importance of what you do.  You're a hero.  We'll be your side-kick!
